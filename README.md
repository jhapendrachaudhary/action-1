# GitHub Actions Demo

This repo is for learning **GitHub Actions**.  
Workflows are stored in `.github/workflows/` as YAML files.  
They run automatically on events like `push` or `pull_request`.  

Example: a CI workflow that installs dependencies and runs tests.  
Check the **Actions tab** in GitHub to see workflows run.
